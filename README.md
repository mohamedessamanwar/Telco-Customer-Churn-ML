# Telco Customer Churn Dataset

## Overview

This dataset contains customer information related to telecommunications services, with a primary focus on predicting customer churn. It is often used for analyzing customer behavior and developing customer retention strategies. The data was originally provided by IBM as part of their sample data sets.

## Context

The context for this dataset is to predict customer behavior in order to retain customers. By analyzing various customer attributes and behaviors, businesses can develop targeted customer retention programs. Understanding why customers leave (churn) and identifying the factors that influence their decisions are essential for businesses in the telecommunications industry.

## Content

The dataset includes a wide range of customer-related information, including:

- **Churn**: A binary column indicating whether a customer left within the last month.
- **Services**: Information about the telecommunications services each customer has signed up for, including phone services, internet services, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies.
- **Customer Account Information**: Details about the customer's account, including how long they've been a customer, contract type, payment method, paperless billing preference, monthly charges, and total charges.
- **Demographic Information**: Demographic data about customers, such as gender, age range, and whether they have partners and dependents.

## Inspiration

This dataset serves as a valuable resource for exploring predictive modeling, machine learning, and data analysis in the context of customer churn prediction. By working with this dataset, you can gain insights into the factors that contribute to customer churn and develop strategies to improve customer retention.
